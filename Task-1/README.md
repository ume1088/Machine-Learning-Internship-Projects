# Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis

##  Task Objective
The objective of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset
to understand feature distributions, relationships, and important patterns in the data.

##  Dataset Used
- Dataset Name: Iris Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Description: The dataset contains 150 observations of iris flowers with four numerical
features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

##  Models Applied
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical analysis
- Data visualization techniques

##  Key Results and Findings
- The dataset contains no missing values.
- Petal length and petal width show strong correlation and clear separation patterns.
- Sepal features are less effective compared to petal features.
- Petal dimensions are the most influential features in the dataset.
